# Work_Day_Scheduler

This repository create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Deployed program: https://bchamidou.github.io/Work_Day_Scheduler/

Technologies Used: HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, moment.js, jQuery

 The calendar was supposed to show the hours from 9am to 5pm. I extended this from 8am - 8pm for further flexibility. The calendar is intuitive, click in the box and add your text, the save button will save the text, even upon refresh or closing the browser and coming back. The delete button will delete the item from the calendar completely. The blocks of time will recognize if they are in the past, present or future and are color coded thusly.

I utilized several coding websites for help, including StackOverflow and w3schools.com I also watched YouTube tutorials and got assistance from fellow student Aurora Brune.

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the Moment.js library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.
